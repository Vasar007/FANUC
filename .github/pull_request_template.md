- Example of good pull request [here](https://github.com/Vasar007/FANUC/pull/26).

- Make sure that your code meets the requirements of our [code style](http://robotlab.apmath.spbu.ru/xwiki/bin/view/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B/%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%20%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8/C%2B%2B%20CS/).
